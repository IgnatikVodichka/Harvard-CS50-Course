sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It is the fastest to quit from sorted list, so I suppose that there is some kind of exit if the list is already sorted.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It was the fastest to sort random 50,000 and 50,000 reversed files.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Because I found the other two methods, that's why I know that this one is selection.
